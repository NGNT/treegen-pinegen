# treegen & pinegen â€“ Voxel Tree Generators

This repo contains two simple standalone tools for generating `.vox` tree models:

- **treegen** â€“ creates classic, natural-looking trees
- **pinegen** â€“ creates cone-shaped pine trees

Both tools output **.vox files** that can be imported directly into **Teardown** maps or other voxel-based games that support the MagicaVoxel `.vox` format.

## ðŸ“¦ Downloads

Each zip contains everything you need â€” just unzip and run the `.exe`.

- [`treegen.zip`](./treegen.zip) â€“ treegen generator
- [`pinegen.zip`](./pinegen.zip) â€“ pinegen generator

No installation required.
Find these files under [Releases](https://github.com/NGNT/treegen-pinegen/releases) for easier downloading.

## ðŸªµ How It Works

- Run the app
- Tweak the sliders and settings
- Click "Generate tree"
- A `.vox` file is created with your tree model, ready for import

Great for adding natural elements to voxel environments quickly and with custom variation.
